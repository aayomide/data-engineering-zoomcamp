## Module 4: Analytical Engineering: Data Transformation & Modelling with DBT

### Learning Summary
- Explored the differences between conventional ETL processes and modern ELT data pipelines
- Successfully setup DBT to connect to the BQ data warehouse and to connect to the GitHub repo sub-directory to store the code files
- Developed and deployed a data transformation pipeline in DBT to preprocess and model the NY taxi tables in BigQuery. The preprocessing steps included removing duplicates, renaming columns, creating new columns, changing data types, creating views and tables, etc.
- Built test scripts to verify data freshness, ensure the uniqueness of table identifiers, and perform various other data quality checks
